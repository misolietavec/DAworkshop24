## Data analysis workshop for beginners (PyCon SK 2024)

We will use `NYC taxi dataset`, data from January, 2015. This is modified
dataset from https://s3.amazonaws.com/datashader-data/nyc_taxi_wide.parq
used in `holoviz` ecosystem https://holoviz.org/. Column names are shortened. 
For workshop we will need only the sample of 310000 records
(`data/nyc_taxi_sample.parq`). Full modified dataset is available at https://feelmath.eu/Download/nyc_taxi.parq.

For running the notebook `final/taxi_panel.ipynb` the modules `panel, ipyleaflet,
polars, pandas, pyarrow, fastparquet, plotly` need to be installed.
